# WebWriter Interactive Video Widget
The Code in this repository is an interactive video Player written in Lit that allows for playing videos and embedding interactive Elements inside of it. It is designed to be used within the [WebWriter Platform](https://webwriter.app/).
This Widget is written as part of my Bachelor Thesis titled "Design & Implementation of an Interactive Video Player in WebWriter".

# Installation
To install the widget, follow npms [Installation Guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)

# Development
This Widget was developed directly within WebWriter for the most part. While I am sure you could also host it locally, using WebWriter was very convenient to work in. For this, just import the WebWriter and if you want, enable hot reloads.

# Usage
After you first load the Widget and upload a Video/provide an URL, just click on the blue "+" Button to try adding an Interaction.
